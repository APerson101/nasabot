According to Bryan's theory, it has been calculated for six speeds ranging from the maximum to the minimum possible speeds for the aeroplane type selected. The value of Routh's discriminant indicates that stability falls off rapidly as speed decreases or angle of attack increases, and that while this aeroplane appears to be very stable at high speeds, it is frankly unstable at speeds below 47 miles per hour."), HumanMessage(content="What is Bryan's theory?"), AIMessage(content=" The purpose of Bryan's theory is to measure the dynamical longitudinal stability of the airplane.")]
